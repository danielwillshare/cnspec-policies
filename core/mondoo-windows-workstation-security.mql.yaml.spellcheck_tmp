query title: Ensure Bitlocker Encryption is Enabled
query description: Encryption processes encode data in a manner that makes it unusable to unauthorized users who do not have the decryption key. The main advantage of encryption is that it turns data into an unreadable form that cannot be used when the notebook is stolen. Windows offers BitLocker, which enables you to encrypt entire drives and prevent unauthorized system changes.
Microsoft designed bitLocker to provide encryption for disk volumes. It is a free and built-in feature in many Windows versions, including Windows Vista and Windows 10. BitLocker asks users for a password, generates a recovery key, and encrypts the entire hard drive.
