OpenSSL [Issue severity](https://www.openssl.org/policies/general/security-policy.html):

This includes issues that are of a lower risk than critical, perhaps due to affecting less common configurations, or which are less likely to be exploitable. These issues will be kept private and will trigger a new release of all supported versions. We will attempt to keep the time these issues are private to a minimum; our aim would be no longer than a month where this is something under our control.

OpenSSL is the most popular open source cryptography and SSL/TLS toolkit. It's used by most HTTPS websites and is the crucial mechanism to encrypt connections to servers. Since OpenSSL is so fundamental to our infrastructure, such a critical vulnerability represents a severe threat to a wide range of businesses and individuals.
